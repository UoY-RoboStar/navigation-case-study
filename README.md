Navigation Case Study
---------------------

This repository contains artifacts for the Navigation case study from the [RoboSAPIENS project](robosapiens-eu.tect), considering a robot navigating through a space, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to faults and sensor occlusions. The repository is structured using the following folders:

* `Concept` - models in the [RoboStar](robostar.cs.york.ac.uk) notations RoboArch and RoboChart, giving the high-level design for the robot software
* `Design` - models in the [Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/projects/architecture-analysis-and-design-language-aadl/), giving the detailed architecture for the robot software
* `Realisation` - source code for the implementation of the robot software
