Navigation Case Study
---------------------

This repository contains artifacts for the Navigation case study from the [RoboSAPIENS project](https://robosapiens-eu.tech), considering a robot navigating through a space, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to faults and sensor occlusions. The repository is structured using the following folders:

* `Concept` - models in the [RoboStar](https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/) notations RoboArch and RoboChart, giving the high-level design for the robot software
* `Design` - models in the [Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/projects/architecture-analysis-and-design-language-aadl/), giving the detailed architecture for the robot software
* `Realisation` - source code for the implementation of the robot software


### Required RoboTool plugins

The RoboArch and RoboChart models are to be used with [RoboTool](https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/), using the following plugins available from the RoboTool Eclipse update site (https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/update/) or the individual update sites listed below:

* `RoboChart Metamodel` (update site: https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/metamodel/update/)
* `RoboChart Textual Editor` (update site: https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/textual/update/)
* `RoboChart Model Importer` (update site: https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/importer/update/)
* `RoboArch Metamodel` (update site: https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/roboarch-metamodel/update/)
* `RoboArch Textual Editor` (update site: https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/roboarch-textual/update/)
* `RoboArch to RoboChart Generator` (update site: https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/roboarch-epsilon/update/)
